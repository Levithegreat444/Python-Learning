# Python-Learning
Notes and practice from CS50P on youtube
I am using this repository to take notes and following along the CS50P lecture videos on youtube to start gaining an understanding of computer programing. I am open to anyone who has information on this or knows what my next steps could be to build skills in this field


# Lecture 0
### 0.1 - Functions, Variables
These lessons are all performed on a text editor program named "Visual Studio Code"

Inside the terminal window is a comand line interface that communicates with the underlying computer.

File name in the terminal window:
code [Insert file name]
File name - hello.py
% the [.py] lets us know the code is written in python language

## Beginning coding and writting scripts.
% print is a function showing text/etc.
print("hello, world")

In the terminal window we can type the comand [python. hello.py] to run our script.
Hit enter and the program should run
hello, world will print

### 0.2 - Functions
Functions allow us to program actions to the command line interface.
Functions require Arguments which are inputs that influences the behavior of the function.
Functions must be contained within parentheses.
Once a function is run through the Command Line Interface (CLI) a side effect is the result, Side effects can be visual, audial, etc.
A mistake that is written within a program effects its functionality and these are called Bugs.

% Language written within a computer program must be specific or the programe will not run.

## Beginning interactive script
input("What's your name? ")
print("hello, world')

Run program (python hello.py)
% Input will ask the user their name but hello, world will print because the argument is not written as part of the print function.

Functions have Return Values that give us an answer to an argument that was inputed to our function.
Variables are place holders for values we write in our code that can give our Functions different outputs.
